# RecyclerView
This application describes about displaying recycler view items.

RecyclerView introduces an additional level of abstraction between the RecyclerView.
Adapter and RecyclerView.LayoutManager to be able to detect data set changes in batches during a layout calculation.
This saves LayoutManager from tracking adapter changes to calculate animations.
