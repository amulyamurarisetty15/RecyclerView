# RecyclerView
This application describes about displaying recycler view items.

#RecyclerView
RecyclerView introduces an additional level of abstraction between the RecyclerView.
Adapter and RecyclerView.LayoutManager to be able to detect data set changes in batches during a layout calculation.
This saves LayoutManager from tracking adapter changes to calculate animations.
The recycler view displays images and textviews in this application.
The images are displayed in a card view which attracts the users.
